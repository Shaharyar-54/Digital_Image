Understanding Features
This chapter introduces the concept of features in images and their importance in tasks like image alignment, stitching, and creating 3D models. Using the analogy of solving a jigsaw puzzle, the text explains how humans and computers identify unique patterns or features in images, such as flat areas, edges, and corners. Corners are highlighted as particularly useful features because they are unique and easily distinguishable.

The chapter also touches on the processes of Feature Detection (finding distinctive patterns like corners) and Feature Description (describing features so they can be matched across images). These techniques are fundamental for aligning images, stitching them together, or other image processing tasks. The following chapters will explore various OpenCV algorithms for detecting, describing, and matching features.
