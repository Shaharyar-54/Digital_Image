# Understanding Features
This chapter introduces the concept of features in images and their importance in tasks like image alignment, stitching, and creating 3D models. Using the analogy of solving a jigsaw puzzle, the text explains how humans and computers identify unique patterns or features in images, such as flat areas, edges, and corners. Corners are highlighted as particularly useful features because they are unique and easily distinguishable.
# Harris Corner Detection
The chapter also touches on the processes of Feature Detection (finding distinctive patterns like corners) and Feature Description (describing features so they can be matched across images). These techniques are fundamental for aligning images, stitching them together, or other image processing tasks. The following chapters will explore various OpenCV algorithms for detecting, describing, and matching features.
This chapter explains the Harris Corner Detection technique, which identifies corners in images by analyzing intensity variations. Corners are regions where the intensity changes significantly in all directions. Developed by Chris Harris and Mike Stephens in 1988, the method uses mathematical formulations to determine whether a region is a corner, edge, or flat area based on eigenvalues derived from image derivatives.

Key steps include:

Compute image derivatives (

𝑥
I 
x
​
  and 
𝐼
𝑦
I 
y
​
 ) using Sobel operators.
Calculate Harris score to classify regions as corners, edges, or flat areas based on eigenvalues.
Threshold the scores to detect corners in the grayscale image.
The OpenCV function cv.cornerHarris() performs this detection. Refining detected corners for higher accuracy is done using cv.cornerSubPix(), which improves precision by refining centroids of detected corner regions.

Code Overview:
Use cv.cornerHarris() to detect corners with parameters for neighborhood size, Sobel kernel size, and a Harris detector free parameter.
Apply dilation and thresholding to mark corners.
For sub-pixel accuracy, use cv.cornerSubPix() with specified iteration criteria and neighborhood size.
